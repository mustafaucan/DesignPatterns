## The .NET Implementation of the Saga Pattern

**Definition:**

This repository showcases a sample .NET project demonstrating the implementation of the Saga pattern. The Saga pattern is a design pattern well-suited for managing long-running transactions that involve multiple services, particularly within microservice architectures.

**Project Overview:**

The project serves as a simple e-commerce application simulating a product purchase experience. It comprises two core services:

* **Order Service:** Handles order creation and management.
* **Stock Service:** Maintains inventory levels and manages product availability.
* **Pay Service** (Implicitly mentioned in the flow): Facilitates payment processing.

**Applying the Saga Pattern:**

The Saga pattern is implemented through the following steps:

1. **Order Creation:** The Order Service initiates a new order and dispatches a message to the Stock Service.
2. **Inventory Check:** The Stock Service verifies product availability and relays a message to the Pay Service (if sufficient stock exists).
3. **Payment Processing:** The Pay Service executes payment processing and transmits a confirmation message back to the Order Service.

**Fault Tolerance:**

The Saga pattern embodies robust error handling mechanisms. If any step encounters an issue, the entire transaction is gracefully rolled back, ensuring data consistency.

**Technologies Employed:**

* **.NET 8:** The latest version of the .NET framework, providing a robust development environment.
* **ASP.NET Core:** A high-performance, open-source framework for building modern web applications.
* **Activity Source:** Simplifies distributed tracing across services for meticulous monitoring.
* **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation):** Enforces a clean separation between data modification (commands) and data retrieval (queries).
* **MassTransit:** A powerful, lightweight service bus for asynchronous communication between services.

**Purpose:**

This project serves as a valuable learning resource for developers seeking to grasp the intricacies of the Saga pattern and its implementation within a .NET microservices architecture.
